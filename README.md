# C# WebDriver Screenshots Extensions
[![nuget](http://flauschig.ch/nubadge.php?id=Noksa.WebDriver.ScreenshotsExtensions)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Noksa.WebDriver.ScreenshotsExtensions/)

## Development frozen
I don't currently have enough time to maintain any C# tool.
Any feature requests can only be implemented if someone else does it.

*IMPORTANT!*

Currently it may have problems when it works with Selenium 4. If you encounter a problem please create an issue.

If you want to take a screenshot of an entire page or a screenshot of a specific element, then this is what you need.<br/>
